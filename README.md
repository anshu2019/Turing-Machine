# Turing Machine
  This code base takes various approach on Turing Machine.
  
  1. Simulate a Turing Machine
     The Turing machine that we will simulate can be formally defined as M = (Q,,,,q0,B): where

	   Q, a finite set of states. For this program Q = {0,1,2,…n-1} and is selected 
          by the client programmer.
	    = { 0,1,B } is the finite set of allowable tape symbols
           B, a symbol of , is the blank
      = { 0,1}, a subset of  not including B, is the set of input symbols
     : Q x    Q x  x {L, R} ( may, however, be undefined for some 
        arguments)
    	q0 = 0 is the initial state  

2. Turing Subtractor Simulation
    The Turing machine that we will simulate can be formally defined as M = (Q,,,,q0,B): where

	  Q, a finite set of states. For this program Q = {0,1,2,…n-1} and is selected 
          by the client programmer.
	   = { 0,1,B } is the finite set of allowable tape symbols
    B, a symbol of , is the blank
     = { 0,1}, a subset of  not including B, is the set of input symbols
    : Q x    Q x  x {L, R} ( may, however, be undefined for some 
        arguments)
  	q0 = 0 is the initial state  
    
 3. Turing Siulation for Language selectors .
    The Turing machine that we will simulate can be formally defined as M = (Q,,,,q0,B): where

	Q, a finite set of states. For this program Q = {0,1,2,…n-1} and is selected 
          by the client programmer.
	   = { 0,1,B } is the finite set of allowable tape symbols
        B, a symbol of , is the blank
     = { 0,1}, a subset of  not including B, is the set of input symbols
    : Q x    Q x  x {L, R} ( may, however, be undefined for some 
        arguments)
	  q0 = 0 is the initial state
